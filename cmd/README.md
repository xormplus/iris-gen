# Internal CLI

This folder contains the internal Iris cli program. It's internal because
it will contain generators for the website, maybe versioning for the github branches etc...
So it's useless for the end-developers, but it will be a good place to learn how you can create your own
cli and dynamic-generators programs.


Click [here](https://github.com/iris-contrib/community-board/issues/2) to learn its future.

> When I use the word "generator" I don't mean the go1.4+ generate feature.

## Don't waste your time, it is not ready yet.
